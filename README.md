# tmux-xdg
> A wrapper for tmux to enforce XDG Base Directory Specification compliance

EDIT: the TMUX developers came around on the issue in [this patch](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/f87be8d0521436c47151233f781794dee94fc1df#diff-c949f93d03f44a4217d7a138f9e2e54aR16), which renders this repository mostly redundant.  It has therefore been archived.
